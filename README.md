# Insider-Trades
A scraper that will collect data about insider trades for various public companies as well as their stock prices at the time of each trade.

The scraper will use data from openinsider.com to gather records of trades and then use yahoo finance to append stock prices at market open and close for each trade.

To use this please download the stock tickers text file for the full list of tickers required to complete the scrape.

Please also create a folder in the same location as the py file called Stock_Sheets so that the files containing stock price data can be stored and used for finding stock data for the specific dates of each trade.
